======

###This is a simple MVC website.  I wrote it to investigate MVC Frameworks. 

##It is not production ready.


It uses [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for it's views and [RedBeanPHP](http://www.redbeanphp.com/) for database access.

It is in development and is currently very basic.

**Upcoming improvements (in no particular order).**

+ Use mod_rewrite to handle and more effectively parse urls.
+ Create a user login interface to allow admins login.
+ Enable CRUD functionality of some form.
+ Improve error handling.
+ Automatic sitemaps.
+ Add some form of front-end framework, (eg Bootstrap or YUI).
+ Generate proper documentation.
