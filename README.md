###This is a simple mvc website.  I wrote it to investigate MVC Frameworks. 

##It is not production ready.


It uses [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for it's views and [RedBeanPHP](http://www.redbeanphp.com/) for database access.

It is in development and is currently very basic.

**Upcomming improvements (in no particular order).**

+ Use mod_rewrite to handle more effectively parse urls.
+ Create a use login interface to alow admins login.
+ Enable CRUD.
+ Improve error handling.
+ Automatic sitemaps.
